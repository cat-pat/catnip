I wanted to make a simple menu, similar to Fzf but that caters to images specifically.
So many want and need a nice and easy way to view and manage images in the terminal
yet we are lacking in any meaningful way to interface with the tools we have today
like fzf, kitty's icat, chafa, sixel etc...

## Requirements

- Kitty or Sixel
- tput and other bash coreutils
- <3

## DISCLAIMER

I've only been programming for less than one year and I still have no idea what the hell
I'm doing most of the time. As such this code is subject to be absolute garbage. Still,
thanks for visiting <3

also sometimes people ask me if my code is licensed, and it kind of touches my heart that people
make it a point to respect that, but no lol why would I license this chicken scratch? take it, steal it,
re-distribute it via writing on the inside of bathroom stalls, it's up to you. Though, I do like the "Poet license"
and "Beer-ware" its all open but if you enjoy it or find it useful, consider buying me a beer/coffee.

## Features

- open it up in Krita
- adding custom functions and image magick operations

>j - up | k - down | h - move left | l - move right | f - set as bg (feh) | m - make bigger | n - make smaller

I aim to make a simple menu, similar to Fzf but that caters to images specifically.
So many want and need a nice and easy way to view and manage images in the terminal
yet we are lacking in any meaningful way to interface with the tools we have today
like fzf, kitty's icat, ueberzug, gum etc...

This aims to provide an easy way to show
and look at images and text in a similar way to fzf, while focusing on images and 
info. I'd like to add a way to pipe in images and display text about them at the same
time. I'd like to browse my music library, or audiobooks while being able to read the
info about the song/book and look at the image. We have like 9000 chatgpt CLI's but
nothing thats actually cool or multifaceted.

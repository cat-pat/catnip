I wanted to make a simple menu, similar to Fzf but that caters to images specifically.
So many want and need a nice and easy way to view and manage images in the terminal
yet we are lacking in any meaningful way to interface with the tools we have today
like fzf, kitty's icat, chafa, sixel etc...

## Requirements

- Kitty or Sixel
- tput and other bash coreutils
- <3
